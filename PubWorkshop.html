							<h1>Hrysovalanti Fereniki Maheras</h1>
							
							<p>Email: hrysovalanti@icloud.com</p>
							<h4>Objective:</h4>
							<p>Hrysovalanti Fereniki Maheras is a PhD student in Digital Media at York University and she is studying with Dr. Mark-David Hosale as a researcher at nD::StudioLab. She holds a B.A. Hons in Media Arts from Plymouth University, UK and an M.A. in Digital Media from York University, CA. In her research,  she speculates on the innovation of computational machines as emotional beings, as she navigates the connections between the philosophical theories written about the human soul, and the cybernetic theories and artworks created for the exploration of the mind of technology. Her practice emphasizes on the creation of groups of electronic sound/kinetic sculptures that act as artificially living communities. Transversing between the virtual and the physical world, she explores the creation of a virtual analog environment emerging in a shared complex physical habitat.</p>
